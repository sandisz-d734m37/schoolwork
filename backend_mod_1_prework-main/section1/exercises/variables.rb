# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Sandisz Thieme"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
harry_bannished = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
p harry_bannished

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
# YOUR CODE HERE
p students + 2

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
# YOUR CODE HERE
p students - 2


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Sandisz"
is_hungry = 3483210 == 3438210
number_of_pets = (128 + 567 - 325 / 3) - 587
p first_name, is_hungry, number_of_pets

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

# Explain.

# I'm not sure I understand the question. But, if I am to assume the "data type" is essentially the type of data,
# I chose a word, my name, for the variable "first_name", I fed the terminal a boolean that was false so it print "false" for the variable "is_hungry" because I was not hungry,
# then I chose to have this file include a math problem resulting in 0 for the variable "number_of_pets" because I have 0 pets!

# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "Something other than Sandisz"
is_hungry = 3483210 != 3438210
number_of_pets = (129 + 567 - 325 / 3) - 587
p first_name, is_hungry, number_of_pets

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

p healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks

#-------------------
# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
